-- PostgreSQL script to create empty views for SQL-to-ARC
-- Based on docs/sql_to_arc_database_views.md
-- These views are created with dummy NULL values and a WHERE false clause
-- to ensure the schema is correct but the views act as empty tables.

-- Drop existing views if they exist to allow clean recreation
